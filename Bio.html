                            <p>Hello! My name is Kailyn Parham and I am a senior at Northwestern University. While pursuing a major in biology and a minor in computer science, I have also conducted experiments as an undergraduate researcher in the Andersen Lab studying the genetics and genomics of complex traits. When not in the lab, I am finding ways to keep marching bands connected during the pandemic with the Northwestern marching band leadership team and supporting the music community with my sorority, Sigma Alpha Iota. In the future, I hope to connect with groups able to utilize my skills in biological and computer sciences and to grow my capabilities as both a researcher and a data scientist! </p>
