                        <p>As part of the Andersen Lab at Northwestern University, I focused on optimizing high-throughput assays to phenotype the roundworm species <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> for use in a genome-wide association (GWA). GWA is one method used to identify genetic variants underlying toxin response differences. To develop the assay, I needed to produce a replicable and scalable food source to feed <i>C. elegans. C. elegans</i> is an ideal model to detect genetic variants because it is compatible with high-throughput phenotyping assays.</p>

                    <div class="item-4">
                        <p>I started with a strain of <i>E. coli</i> bacteria called HB101 as the food source with the goal of identifying the bacterial growth point that was most reproducible and best suited for high-throughput assays. After selecting timepoints for bacterial growth at 5, 10, 15, and 72 hours, the bacterial growth process was repeated multiple times to observe reproducibility. Then, the food was tested on 96-well plates in high-throughput phenotyping assays to analyze how the food affected the nematodes. A COPAS Biosort machine was used to collect phenotypic data of the nematode populations such as the size of each individual and the population present in each well of the plates. Furthermore, the nematodes were manually measured using a program called ImageJ so they could be sorted by length from L1 to adult. </p>

                    <div class="item-5">
                        <p>After analyzing and visualizing the data using R, I found the food at 72 hours resulted in the highest amount of L4s. While the food at 5 hours resulted in the largest nematodes, they were already past the L4 developmental stage I was looking for, so the 5 hour food was eliminated. The 15 hour food was selected as the optimal food because it resulted in healthy, L4 staged nematodes and could be prepared in one day. Once an optimized procedure was finalized, further replications of the experiment were performed to ensure the results were sustainable over multiple batches and users. </p>
